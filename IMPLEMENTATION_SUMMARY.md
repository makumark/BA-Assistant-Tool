# Implementation Summary - Domain-Agnostic BRD Generator

## Overview

Successfully implemented a **domain-agnostic Business Requirements Document (BRD) generator** for the BA Assistant Tool that follows the exact structure and methodology specified in the problem statement.

## Problem Statement Requirements ✅

The implementation addresses all requirements from the problem statement:

### ✅ Structure Requirements
- **Scope of the Project** with In Scope, Out of Scope, and Boundaries & Dependencies
- **Business Objectives** with OBJ-# IDs and one-sentence hypotheses
- **EPICs** with EPIC-<area>-# IDs, Problem/Value/Capabilities/Constraints/Acceptance
- **Success Metrics & KPIs** with KPI-# IDs, formulas, targets, frequency, source, owner, and traceability
- **Risk Assessment & Mitigation** with RISK-# IDs, likelihood, impact, triggers, mitigation, contingency

### ✅ Formatting Requirements
- Concise business language with flat bullet lists
- Short paragraphs
- Domain-agnostic approach without vendor-specific assumptions
- TBV (To Be Validated) markers for inferred content with one-line rationales
- Proper alignment between Objectives ↔ EPICs ↔ KPIs ↔ Validations

### ✅ ID Format Requirements
- `OBJ-#` for objectives (OBJ-1, OBJ-2, etc.)
- `EPIC-<area>-#` for EPICs (EPIC-AP-1, EPIC-AR-2, EPIC-GL-3, etc.)
- `KPI-#` for KPIs (KPI-1, KPI-2, etc.)
- `RISK-#` for risks (RISK-1, RISK-2, etc.)

## Technical Implementation

### New Module: `ai_service_domain_agnostic.py`

Created a comprehensive module (~600 lines) with:

1. **Input Parsing Functions**
   - `_extract_scope_items()` - Parses In/Out scope with parentheses preservation
   - `_extract_objectives()` - Splits objectives by semicolons
   - `_extract_requirements_by_area()` - Organizes requirements by functional area
   - `_extract_validations()` - Parses validation rules
   - `_create_area_abbreviation()` - Creates intelligent area codes (AP, AR, GL, BANK, FA, REP)

2. **Main Generator Function**
   - `generate_domain_agnostic_brd_html()` - Generates complete BRD with all sections

### Integration with Existing Code

Modified `ai_service.py` to use domain-agnostic generator as primary method:

```python
def generate_brd_html(project: str, inputs: Dict[str, Any], version: int) -> str:
    # 1. Try domain-agnostic generator (NEW - primary method)
    # 2. Fallback to Agentic RAG if available
    # 3. Fallback to traditional AI/local generation
```

This ensures backward compatibility while providing the new functionality.

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite with 5 test files:

1. **test_domain_agnostic_brd.py** - Financial Accounting System (from problem statement)
2. **test_multiple_domains.py** - Healthcare and E-commerce domains
3. **test_brd_comparison.py** - Side-by-side comparison of old vs new format
4. **test_service_integration.py** - End-to-end service layer testing
5. **test_fixed_epic_generation.py** - Existing EPIC tests (verified no regressions)

## Example Output

### Financial Accounting System BRD Structure

```
Business Requirements Document (BRD)
Financial Accounting System — Version 1

1. Scope of the Project
   In Scope:
   • chart of accounts and journal processing
   • payables (invoice capture/3 way match, approvals, payments)
   • receivables (invoicing, receipts, dunning)
   • bank reconciliation and cash management
   • fixed assets and depreciation
   • period close and financial reporting
   • role based admin and audit
   
   Out of Scope:
   • full ERP replacement
   • treasury trading platform
   • tax engine re platform
   • payroll processing in phase 1
   
   Boundaries & Dependencies:
   • Cleansed master data (vendors/customers/COA) available
   • banking/payment and e invoicing providers provisioned
   [...]

2. Business Objectives
   OBJ-1 Accelerate month end close; Hypothesis: enhanced capabilities will lead to measurable improvement.
   OBJ-2 improve invoice cycle time and on time payments; Hypothesis: enhanced capabilities will lead to measurable improvement.
   [...]

3. EPICs
   EPIC-AP-1: Accounts Payable
   Problem: Manual or inefficient accounts payable processes create operational bottlenecks
   Value: Streamlined accounts payable capabilities improve efficiency and accuracy
   
   Capabilities:
   • vendor master
   • invoice ingestion (PDF/e invoice)
   • 2/3 way match
   • approvals
   • payment runs
   • credit notes
   
   Constraints & Validations:
   • Mandatory master data fields
   • duplicate detection (vendor/customer and invoice numbers)
   
   Acceptance:
   • TBV: Measurable acceptance criteria to be defined (e.g., processing time, error rates)
   • TBV: User acceptance and functional completeness criteria
   
   [5 more EPICs: EPIC-AR-2, EPIC-GL-3, EPIC-BANK-4, EPIC-FA-5, EPIC-REP-6]

4. Success Metrics & KPIs
   KPI-1: Process Cycle Time
   Formula: Average time from initiation to completion
   Target: TBV: Baseline and target to be established
   Frequency: Monthly
   Data Source: TBV: Primary transaction system
   Owner: Operations Manager
   Traceability: Linked to OBJ-1
   
   [5 more KPIs: KPI-2 through KPI-6]

5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation
   RISK-1: Data Quality
   Description: Incomplete or inconsistent source data may impact system functionality
   Likelihood: Medium | Impact: High | Score: M×H
   Triggers: Data validation failures during initial load
   Mitigation: Conduct data profiling and cleansing prior to migration; implement validation checkpoints
   Contingency: Staged data migration with fallback to manual processes
   
   [5 more risks: RISK-2 through RISK-6]
```
