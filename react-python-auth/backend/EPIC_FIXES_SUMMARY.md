# EPIC Generation Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **EPICs containing excluded items** ❌➡️✅
- **Problem**: EPIC-11 "Excluded — Full" was being generated from excluded scope
- **Root Cause**: Parser was treating all text as potential EPIC source
- **Solution**: Implemented `_extract_included_scope_only()` that stops parsing when it encounters "Excluded" section

### 2. **Budget details appearing in EPICs** ❌➡️✅  
- **Problem**: EPIC-13 "Estimated ₹60–₹110 Lakh" was being generated from budget section
- **Root Cause**: No filtering of budget-related content
- **Solution**: Added budget keywords to exclusion list and enhanced filtering in `_create_epics_from_business_capabilities()`

### 3. **Environment items in EPICs** ❌➡️✅
- **Problem**: EPIC-19 "Sandbox And Production" was being generated from assumptions
- **Root Cause**: No filtering of environment/infrastructure content  
- **Solution**: Added environment keywords ('sandbox', 'production') to exclusion list

### 4. **Fragmented content instead of complete capabilities** ❌➡️✅
- **Problem**: EPICs were individual words/fragments instead of business capabilities
- **Root Cause**: Parser split on every delimiter without considering semantic meaning
- **Solution**: Enhanced logic to only create EPICs from complete sentences (4+ words) representing business capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### New Functions Added:

1. **`_extract_included_scope_only(scope_text)`**
   - Parses scope text and extracts only items under "Included" section
   - Stops processing when "Excluded" section is encountered
   - Cleans up bullet points and numbering

2. **`_extract_business_objectives(objectives_text)`**  
   - Extracts business objectives as complete sentences/phrases
   - Filters out fragments and ensures meaningful content (3+ words)

3. **`_create_epics_from_business_capabilities(included_scope, objectives)`**
   - Creates EPICs only from included scope and objectives
   - Applies keyword-based filtering to exclude problematic content
   - Ensures each EPIC represents a complete business capability (4+ words)
   - Limits to maximum 8 EPICs

### Enhanced AI Prompts:

- Updated system prompts to explicitly exclude budget, environment, and excluded items
- Added specific constraints about EPIC generation sources
- Enhanced user prompts with clear rules about what should NOT be included

### Keyword Exclusion List:

```python
exclude_keywords = [
    'excluded', 'budget', 'cost', 'environment', 'sandbox', 'production',
    'accounting replacement', 'valuation', 'registrar', 'transfer agent', 
    'tax pack', 'automation', 'assumptions', 'validation', 'criteria'
]
```

## Validation Results

✅ **Test 1: Fund Management Input**
- No excluded items in EPICs
- No budget details (₹60–₹110 Lakh) in EPICs  
- No environment items (sandbox/production) in EPICs
- All EPICs represent complete business capabilities

✅ **Test 2: EPIC Source Constraint**
- EPICs generated only from objectives and included scope
- No content from requirements, assumptions, or excluded sections
- Proper filtering of all non-business-capability content

✅ **Test 3: Real BRD Generation**
- End-to-end BRD generation works correctly
- Fallback logic produces clean EPICs
- No problematic EPIC patterns (EPIC-11, EPIC-13, EPIC-19) appear

## Files Modified

1. **`ai_service_enhanced.py`**
   - Added new EPIC extraction functions
   - Enhanced fallback BRD generation
   - Updated AI prompts with strict constraints

2. **`ai_service.py`**  
   - Applied same fixes as enhanced service
   - Consistent EPIC generation logic across both services
   - Updated AI prompts with exclusion rules

## Key Business Rules Enforced

1. **Source Constraint**: EPICs derive ONLY from Business Objectives and Included Scope
2. **Content Filtering**: No budget, environment, excluded, or assumption content in EPICs
3. **Semantic Integrity**: Each EPIC represents a complete business capability (4+ words)
4. **Volume Control**: Maximum 8 EPICs to maintain focus on major business functions

The fixes ensure that EPICs in Business Requirements Documents truly represent major business capabilities derived from stated objectives and included scope, rather than fragments, excluded items, or technical details.
