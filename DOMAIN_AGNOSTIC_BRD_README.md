# Domain-Agnostic BRD Generator - Quick Reference

## What Was Changed

The BA Assistant Tool now generates **domain-agnostic Business Requirements Documents (BRDs)** that follow a standardized, professional structure regardless of the business domain.

## Key Improvements

### Before (Old Format)
- Generic "Business Requirements" section with simple "The system shall..." statements
- No structured EPICs
- Missing KPI and Risk Assessment sections
- No traceability IDs
- Domain-specific assumptions embedded in generation
- ~5,000 characters of basic content

### After (New Format)
- **5 Major Sections** with proper structure:
  1. Scope of the Project (In/Out/Dependencies)
  2. Business Objectives (with OBJ-# IDs and hypotheses)
  3. EPICs (with EPIC-<area>-# IDs, Problem/Value/Capabilities/Acceptance)
  4. Success Metrics & KPIs (with KPI-# IDs and traceability)
  5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation (with RISK-# IDs)
- **TBV Markers** clearly show inferred content
- **Traceability** links objectives to EPICs to KPIs
- **Domain-agnostic** approach works for any industry
- ~23,000 characters of comprehensive content

## Generated Structure Example

```
Business Requirements Document (BRD)
Financial Accounting System — Version 1

1. Scope of the Project
   In Scope
   • chart of accounts and journal processing
   • payables (invoice capture/3 way match, approvals, payments)
   • receivables (invoicing, receipts, dunning)
   [...]
   
   Out of Scope
   • full ERP replacement
   • treasury trading platform
   [...]
   
   Boundaries & Dependencies
   • Cleansed master data (vendors/customers/COA) available
   [...]

2. Business Objectives
   OBJ-1 Accelerate month end close; Hypothesis: enhanced capabilities will lead to measurable improvement.
   OBJ-2 improve invoice cycle time and on time payments; Hypothesis: enhanced capabilities will lead to measurable improvement.
   [...]

3. EPICs
   EPIC-AP-1: Accounts Payable
   Problem: Manual or inefficient accounts payable processes create operational bottlenecks
   Value: Streamlined accounts payable capabilities improve efficiency and accuracy
   
   Capabilities:
   • vendor master
   • invoice ingestion (PDF/e invoice)
   • 2/3 way match
   [...]
   
   Constraints & Validations:
   • Mandatory master data fields
   • duplicate detection (vendor/customer and invoice numbers)
   
   Acceptance:
   • TBV: Measurable acceptance criteria to be defined (e.g., processing time, error rates)
   [...]

4. Success Metrics & KPIs
   KPI-1: Process Cycle Time
   Formula: Average time from initiation to completion
   Target: TBV: Baseline and target to be established
   Frequency: Monthly
   Data Source: TBV: Primary transaction system
   Owner: Operations Manager
   Traceability: Linked to OBJ-1
   [...]

5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation
   RISK-1: Data Quality
   Description: Incomplete or inconsistent source data may impact system functionality
   Likelihood: Medium | Impact: High | Score: M×H
   Triggers: Data validation failures during initial load
   Mitigation: Conduct data profiling and cleansing prior to migration; implement validation checkpoints
   Contingency: Staged data migration with fallback to manual processes
   [...]
```

## Files Changed

### New Files
- `react-python-auth/backend/app/services/ai_service_domain_agnostic.py` - Main implementation
- `react-python-auth/backend/test_domain_agnostic_brd.py` - Financial accounting test
- `react-python-auth/backend/test_multiple_domains.py` - Healthcare and e-commerce tests
- `react-python-auth/backend/test_brd_comparison.py` - Old vs new comparison
- `react-python-auth/backend/test_service_integration.py` - Service layer integration test
- `DOMAIN_AGNOSTIC_BRD_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Detailed documentation

### Modified Files
- `react-python-auth/backend/app/services/ai_service.py` - Integrated domain-agnostic generator as primary method
- `.gitignore` - Added Python cache exclusions

## How to Use

### Through API (Existing Endpoints)
No changes needed! The existing BRD generation endpoints now automatically use the domain-agnostic generator:

```python
POST /api/v1/ai/brd
{
  "project": "My Project Name",
  "version": 1,
  "inputs": {
    "scope": "Included — item1, item2; Excluded — item3",
    "objectives": "Objective 1; Objective 2; Objective 3",
    "briefRequirements": "Area1: req1; req2. Area2: req3; req4.",
    "assumptions": "Assumption 1; Assumption 2",
    "validations": "Validation 1; Validation 2"
  }
}
```

### Direct Usage (Python)
```python
from app.services.ai_service import generate_brd_html

html = generate_brd_html(
    project="Financial Accounting System",
    inputs={
        "scope": "...",
        "objectives": "...",
        "briefRequirements": "...",
        "assumptions": "...",
        "validations": "..."
    },
    version=1
)
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
cd react-python-auth/backend

# Test financial accounting (from problem statement)
python test_domain_agnostic_brd.py

# Test multiple domains (healthcare, e-commerce)
python test_multiple_domains.py

# Compare old vs new format
python test_brd_comparison.py

# Test service integration
python test_service_integration.py

# Test EPIC generation (existing test)
python test_fixed_epic_generation.py
```

All tests passing ✅

## Input Format Guidelines

### Scope
```
Included — item1, item2 (with details), item3
Excluded — item4, item5
```

### Objectives
Separate with semicolons:
```
Objective 1; Objective 2; Objective 3
```

### Brief Requirements
Use area prefixes:
```
AP: requirement1; requirement2; requirement3.
AR: requirement1; requirement2.
GL & Close: requirement1; requirement2.
```

### Assumptions & Validations
Separate with semicolons:
```
Assumption 1; Assumption 2; Assumption 3
```

## Area Abbreviations

The generator creates intelligent abbreviations for EPIC IDs:

| Area Name | Abbreviation | Example EPIC ID |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| AP | AP | EPIC-AP-1 |
| AR | AR | EPIC-AR-2 |
| GL & Close | GL | EPIC-GL-3 |
| Bank & Cash | BANK | EPIC-BANK-4 |
| Assets | FA | EPIC-FA-5 |
| Reporting | REP | EPIC-REP-6 |
| Registration | REGI | EPIC-REGI-1 |
| Scheduling | SCHE | EPIC-SCHE-2 |

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- Existing API endpoints unchanged
- Old generation methods available as fallbacks
- No breaking changes to client code
- Agentic RAG integration preserved

## Benefits

1. **Consistency** - Same structure across all domains
2. **Traceability** - Clear links between objectives, EPICs, KPIs, and risks
3. **Professional** - Ready for stakeholder review
4. **Transparent** - TBV markers show what needs validation
5. **Comprehensive** - All required sections included
6. **Domain-Agnostic** - No assumptions about business domain
7. **Maintainable** - Single source of truth for BRD structure

## Next Steps

The domain-agnostic BRD generator is production-ready and active. Consider:

1. **Customization** - Add project-specific templates or sections
2. **AI Enhancement** - Use AI to generate better objectives/KPIs when not provided
3. **Validation** - Add validation rules for input completeness
4. **Templates** - Create domain-specific templates that follow the structure
5. **Export** - Add PDF/Word export capabilities
6. **Localization** - Support multiple languages
