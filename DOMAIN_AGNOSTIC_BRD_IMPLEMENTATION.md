# Domain-Agnostic BRD Generator - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds a **domain-agnostic Business Requirements Document (BRD) generator** to the BA Assistant Tool. The generator follows a standardized structure and methodology that works consistently across all business domains without requiring domain-specific customization.

## Problem Statement

The original BRD generation was:
- Domain-specific and made assumptions based on detected business domain
- Missing key sections like EPICs, KPIs, and Risk Assessment
- Lacking proper traceability IDs
- Not marking inferred content as "To Be Validated (TBV)"
- Using inconsistent formatting and structure

## Solution

A new `ai_service_domain_agnostic.py` module implements a standardized BRD generation approach with:

### Required Sections

1. **Scope of the Project**
   - In Scope (flat bullet list)
   - Out of Scope (flat bullet list)
   - Boundaries & Dependencies

2. **Business Objectives**
   - Format: `OBJ-#` for each objective
   - Each includes one-sentence objective + one-sentence hypothesis

3. **EPICs**
   - Format: `EPIC-<area>-#` (e.g., EPIC-AP-1, EPIC-GL-2)
   - Each EPIC includes:
     - Problem statement
     - Value proposition
     - Capabilities (bulleted list from requirements)
     - Constraints & Validations
     - Acceptance criteria (marked as TBV when not provided)

4. **Success Metrics & KPIs**
   - Format: `KPI-#` for each metric
   - Each includes:
     - Name and formula
     - Target (marked as TBV when not provided)
     - Frequency
     - Data source/system of record
     - Owner role
     - Traceability link to objectives/EPICs

5. **Risk Assessment & Mitigation**
   - Format: `RISK-#` for each risk
   - Each includes:
     - Category
     - Likelihood and Impact
     - Score (L×I)
     - Triggers
     - Mitigation strategy
     - Contingency plan

### Key Features

✅ **Domain-Agnostic**: Works consistently for any business domain (Finance, Healthcare, E-commerce, etc.)
✅ **Traceability**: Proper ID formats enable cross-referencing between objectives, EPICs, KPIs, and risks
✅ **TBV Markers**: Clearly marks inferred or placeholder content as "To Be Validated (TBV)"
✅ **Concise Language**: Uses flat bullet lists and short paragraphs
✅ **Professional Formatting**: Clean HTML with proper sections and styling
✅ **Smart Parsing**: Preserves structure in parentheses (e.g., "payables (invoice capture...)")

## Implementation Details

### File Structure

```
react-python-auth/backend/app/services/
├── ai_service.py                      # Main service (updated to use domain-agnostic)
├── ai_service_domain_agnostic.py     # New domain-agnostic generator
├── ai_service_enhanced.py             # Enhanced generator (existing)
└── ai_service_new.py                  # Alternative generator (existing)
```

### Integration

The domain-agnostic generator is integrated as the **primary method** in `ai_service.py`:

```python
def generate_brd_html(project: str, inputs: Dict[str, Any], version: int) -> str:
    # 1. Try domain-agnostic generator (primary)
    # 2. Fallback to Agentic RAG if available
    # 3. Fallback to traditional AI/local generation
```

### Area Abbreviations

The generator creates intuitive area abbreviations for EPIC IDs:

- `AP` → Accounts Payable
- `AR` → Accounts Receivable
- `GL` → General Ledger
- `BANK` → Bank & Cash
- `FA` → Fixed Assets
- `REP` → Reporting
- Custom abbreviations for other areas

## Testing

### Test Files

1. **test_domain_agnostic_brd.py** - Tests financial accounting example from problem statement
2. **test_multiple_domains.py** - Verifies domain-agnostic nature with healthcare and e-commerce
3. **test_brd_comparison.py** - Compares old vs new BRD format
4. **test_service_integration.py** - Tests integration through service layer

### Test Results

All tests passing with 100% validation:

```
✅ Scope section with In/Out/Dependencies
✅ Business Objectives with OBJ-# IDs
✅ EPICs with EPIC-<area>-# IDs
✅ KPIs with KPI-# IDs and traceability
✅ Risk Assessment with RISK-# IDs
✅ TBV markers for inferred content
✅ Hypothesis statements for objectives
✅ Problem/Value statements for EPICs
✅ Domain-agnostic across Finance, Healthcare, E-commerce
```

## Example Output

### Financial Accounting System BRD

**Sections Generated:**
- Scope: 7 included items, 4 excluded items, 5 dependencies
- Objectives: 6 objectives with hypotheses (OBJ-1 to OBJ-6)
- EPICs: 6 EPICs (EPIC-AP-1, EPIC-AR-2, EPIC-GL-3, EPIC-BANK-4, EPIC-FA-5, EPIC-REP-6)
- KPIs: 6 KPIs with formulas and traceability
- Risks: 6 risks with mitigation and contingency

**Sample EPIC:**
```
EPIC-AP-1: Accounts Payable

Problem: Manual or inefficient accounts payable processes create operational bottlenecks
Value: Streamlined accounts payable capabilities improve efficiency and accuracy

Capabilities:
• vendor master
• invoice ingestion (PDF/e invoice)
• 2/3 way match
• approvals
• payment runs
• credit notes

Constraints & Validations:
• Mandatory master data fields
• duplicate detection (vendor/customer and invoice numbers)

Acceptance:
• TBV: Measurable acceptance criteria to be defined (e.g., processing time, error rates)
• TBV: User acceptance and functional completeness criteria
```

## Usage

### Direct Usage

```python
from app.services.ai_service_domain_agnostic import generate_domain_agnostic_brd_html

html = generate_domain_agnostic_brd_html(
    project="My Project",
    inputs={
        "scope": "...",
        "objectives": "...",
        "briefRequirements": "...",
        "assumptions": "...",
        "validations": "..."
    },
    version=1
)
```

### Through Main Service (Recommended)

```python
from app.services.ai_service import generate_brd_html

html = generate_brd_html(
    project="My Project",
    inputs={...},
    version=1
)
# Automatically uses domain-agnostic generator as primary method
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Same structure regardless of business domain
2. **Traceability**: Clear links between objectives, EPICs, KPIs, and risks
3. **Transparency**: TBV markers show what needs validation
4. **Professional**: Clean, well-formatted output ready for stakeholder review
5. **Maintainable**: Centralized logic easier to update and enhance
6. **Testable**: Clear structure enables automated validation

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- AI-enhanced generation of objectives when not provided
- Smarter EPIC problem/value generation based on context
- Dynamic KPI generation based on objectives

- Traditional AI generation still works
- No breaking changes to API or service interfaces

## Conclusion

The domain-agnostic BRD generator successfully addresses all requirements from the problem statement:

✅ Domain-agnostic methodology
✅ Required sections (Scope, Objectives, EPICs, KPIs, Risks)
✅ Proper ID formats (OBJ-#, EPIC-<area>-#, KPI-#, RISK-#)
✅ TBV markers for inferred content
✅ Concise business language
✅ Flat bullet lists
✅ No vendor-specific assumptions
✅ Alignment and traceability between sections

The implementation is production-ready and tested across multiple business domains.
